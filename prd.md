# Drama Guard ‚Äî MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 0.1 (MVP)
**Date:** August 25, 2025
**Owner:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Eng, Design, Security/Privacy, Customer Pilot Champions

---

## 1) Summary

Drama Guard MVP is a **Slack bot** that can be **invited** into public channels, private channels, and DMs (with the bot). When present, it detects messages that fall **below the line** (Drama Triangle roles: Persecutor, Victim, Rescuer) and sends **private nudges** to the author to help them shift **above the line** (ownership, clarity, curiosity).

> **Out of scope for MVP:** Org-wide assessments, dashboards, KPI tiles, exports/Discovery, long-term storage of message content, cross‚Äëplatform support (e.g., Microsoft Teams), and any per-user scorecards.

**Why now**: Teams want lightweight, non-judgmental coaching *in the moment* without governance overhead. MVP focuses solely on real‚Äëtime nudges where the bot is explicitly present.

---

## 2) Goals & Non‚ÄëGoals

**Goals**

* Provide **real-time, private coaching** via ephemerals/DM to reduce drama language in Slack.
* Be **easy to install and invite** by any motivated individual (subject to workspace settings).
* Maintain **privacy by design** (consent-first coverage; minimal data retention).

**Non‚ÄëGoals (MVP)**

* No org-wide analytics or health reports.
* No admin dashboards beyond install/config basics.
* No multi-tenant exports or Discovery API usage.

---

## 3) Scope

**In scope**

* Slack app with Bot user using granular permissions.
* Real-time detection of below-the-line language in conversations the bot can see.
* Private coaching nudges with suggested rewrites and micro-prompts.
* Minimal controls: slash commands, App Home toggles, thumbs up/down feedback.

**Out of scope**

* KPI charts, role mix trends, leaderboards, heatmaps, digests.
* Storage of raw message bodies beyond transient processing window.
* MS Teams or other platforms.

---

## 4) Personas

* **Teammate (Author):** Wants help phrasing messages constructively; fears public shaming. Receives private nudges.
* **Channel Champion/Manager:** Invites the bot into high-friction threads/channels; ensures team buy‚Äëin. Needs simple on/off and pause controls.
* **Workspace Admin:** Installs/approves the app; cares that it is consent-first, minimally invasive, and compliant.

---

## 5) User Stories (MVP)

**Must‚Äëhave**

1. *As a teammate*, I can **invite** Drama Guard to a public or private channel so it can coach me in that space.
2. *As a teammate*, when I write a message that appears **below the line**, I get a **private nudge** (ephemeral if possible) with:

   * A plain-language reflection (what might be happening)
   * A **rewrite suggestion**
   * A **micro-prompt** (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat outcome do I want?‚Äù)
   * **Insert** / **Try again** actions
3. *As a teammate*, I can **pause/resume** nudges for myself.
4. *As a champion*, I can **pause/resume** nudges for a channel.
5. *As an admin*, I can **install** the app (or approve end‚Äëuser installs per workspace policy) and see a basic **App Home** with settings and help.

**Should‚Äëhave**
6\. *As a teammate*, I can give **thumbs up/down** on suggestions to improve future nudges.
7\. *As a teammate*, I can use a **message action** (e.g., ‚ÄúGet coaching‚Äù) to request a one‚Äëoff rewrite even if the bot didn‚Äôt auto‚Äënudge.

**Could‚Äëhave** (post-MVP)
8\. Nudge **tone styles** (concise, warm, formal).
9\. **Practice mode** in DM with the bot for training outside of live channels.

## 6) Core Experience

### 6.1 Trigger & Detection

* Bot listens to message events in conversations where it is present (public channel joined, private channel invited, DM with bot or MPIM including bot).
* Each new message is scored by a lightweight classifier for **Persecutor/Victim/Rescuer** cues and overall **‚Äúbelow-the-line‚Äù confidence**.
* If above threshold and not rate-limited, proceed to nudge.

### 6.2 Nudge Delivery

* **Primary:** `chat.postEphemeral` to the **author** in-channel (private to them).
* **Fallback:** DM the author if ephemeral cannot be delivered (user inactive).
* Nudge content:

  * Short reflection (e.g., ‚ÄúThis reads like blame‚Ä¶‚Äù)
  * 1‚Äì2 rewrite options
  * Micro-prompt
  * Buttons: **Insert rewrite** (posts an edited draft in composer via `chat.postMessage`/copy workflow), **Rephrase again** (regenerates), **Dismiss**.

### 6.3 Controls

* Slash commands (tentative):

  * `/drama help` ‚Äî quick usage & links
  * `/drama pause` / `/drama resume` ‚Äî per-user toggle
  * `/drama pause here` / `/drama resume here` ‚Äî channel toggle (requires permission)
  * `/drama coach` ‚Äî open modal for on-demand coaching of selected text
* App Home: global pause, learn the model, privacy details, feedback switch.

### 6.4 Guardrails

* **Rate limiting:** max N nudges per user per hour; per-channel cooldown windows; dedupe on thread.
* **Confidence thresholds:** only nudge when confident, else silently log a low-confidence event (aggregate counts only).
* **Safety language:** empathetic tone; never shame; provide opt-out link in DM.

---

## 7) Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Slack Integration

* **Events:** `message.channels`, `message.groups`, `message.mpim`, `app_mention` (and `message.im` only if DM coaching is enabled).
* **Scopes (granular bot):**

  * Read: `channels:read`, `groups:read`, `channels:history`, `groups:history`, `mpim:history`, (`im:history` if DM with bot), `users:read`.
  * Write: `chat:write`, `chat:write.public` (optional), `reactions:write` (for feedback), `commands`.
* **Coverage reality:** Bot **only** sees conversations it‚Äôs a member of; private channels require invite; no reading users‚Äô DMs unless it‚Äôs a DM **with the bot**.

### 7.2 Detection Engine

* **Classifier:** heuristic + LLM few-shot prompt for role detection (P, V, R) with confidence; lightweight profanity/hostility filter.
* **Latency target:** nudge composed and sent **‚â§ 3s P95** from message timestamp.
* **Content policy:** reject generating targeted harassment; always offer neutral tone rewrites.

### 7.3 Nudge Generator

* Prompt templates per role with **rewrite macros** (facts ‚Üí request; blame ‚Üí concern; helpless ‚Üí ownership; rescuing ‚Üí coaching).
* Personalization: remember user‚Äôs last chosen tone (if enabled).
* Insert flow: provide copy-to-clipboard or prefilled draft via DM; for public posting, always require **user action** (never auto-post on their behalf).

### 7.4 Controls & Feedback

* Slash commands + App Home toggles; per-user and per-channel state.
* Feedback: üëç/üëé attaches to message-id + anonymized label for model tuning (no raw text stored past retention window).

### 7.5 Data & Privacy

* Processing: **in-memory/ephemeral**; store only minimal **event metadata** + **model labels** for short retention (e.g., 0‚Äì7 days, default 0).
* No storage of raw message bodies beyond transient feature extraction buffer (<60s).
* Pseudonymous telemetry only (counts of nudges, acceptance, thumbs up/down). No individual scorecards.
* Clear `/drama delete-my-data` path to purge any retained user-specific preferences.

## 8) Non‚ÄëFunctional Requirements

* **Performance:** P95 nudge latency ‚â§ 3s; 99th ‚â§ 5s.
* **Reliability:** ‚â• 99.5% weekly success rate on eligible nudges; retries on Slack HTTP 429s per backoff.
* **Security:** TLS in transit; encrypted storage at rest; least-privilege IAM; signed releases.
* **Compatibility:** English only; Slack Free/Pro/B+/Enterprise. Install flow must work for user‚Äëinitiated installs where workspace policy allows; otherwise request admin approval.
* **Observability:** basic metrics (nudge attempts/sent/skipped; reasons), structured logs (no message bodies), alerting on error rate.

---

## 9) Success Metrics (MVP)

* **Activation:** ‚â• 20 pilot workspaces install; ‚â• 50 channels invited.
* **Engagement:** ‚â• 30% weekly active authors (received ‚â•1 nudge).
* **Quality:** ‚â• 65% positive feedback (üëç) on nudges; **false positive rate** ‚â§ 15% (measured via thumbs down + manual spot checks).
* **Latency:** P95 ‚â§ 3s in production week 2.

---

## 10) Milestones & Deliverables

**M0 ‚Äî Tech Spike (1‚Äì2 weeks)**

* Slack app scaffold; event subscription; ephemeral + DM fallback; minimal classifier stub; `/drama pause/resume`.

**M1 ‚Äî Alpha (3‚Äì4 weeks)**

* Role detector v1 (LLM + heuristics), nudge templates v1, per-user/channel state, rate limiting, App Home basics, feedback üëç/üëé.

**M2 ‚Äî Beta (2‚Äì3 weeks)**

* Tone preference (optional), message action ‚ÄúGet coaching,‚Äù improved prompts, observability, security review, pilot docs.

**Launch criteria**

* Meets Success Metrics; zero P0 security issues; clear privacy policy.

---

## 11) Risks & Mitigations

* **False positives** ‚Üí Conservative thresholds; quick ‚ÄúDismiss‚Äù and per-user pause; continuous template tuning.
* **User backlash** ‚Üí Empathetic language; easy opt-out; channel-level pause; clear install comms.
* **Rate limits** ‚Üí Batch classification, jitter, shared queue with backoff.
* **Workspace policy variance** ‚Üí Document that some installs require admin approval; provide request‚Äëapproval flow.

## 12) Appendix

### 12.1 Example Nudge Templates

* **Persecutor ‚Üí Challenger**

  * *Reflection:* ‚ÄúThis might read as blame.‚Äù
  * *Rewrite:* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm concerned about **\[specific]**. Can we align on **\[criteria]** and next steps?‚Äù
  * *Prompt:* ‚ÄúWhat outcome do I want?‚Äù
* **Victim ‚Üí Ownership**

  * *Reflection:* ‚ÄúThis might read as powerless.‚Äù
  * *Rewrite:* ‚ÄúI missed **\[context]**. I can deliver **\[X]** by **\[time]** if we clarify **\[Y]**‚Äîcan someone confirm?‚Äù
  * *Prompt:* ‚ÄúWhat can I do in the next 24h?‚Äù
* **Rescuer ‚Üí Coach**

  * *Reflection:* ‚ÄúThis might jump into fixing.‚Äù
  * *Rewrite:* ‚ÄúHappy to help‚Äîwhat have you tried, and where would feedback be most useful?‚Äù
  * *Prompt:* ‚ÄúWhat support was asked for?‚Äù
