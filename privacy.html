      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Drama Guard helps teams reduce drama patterns in Slack by providing privacy-first coaching
        and anonymized organizational insights. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect,
        how we use it, how we share it, and the choices and rights available to you.
      </p>

      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        Drama Guard operates the service available at <a href="https://dramaguard.io">dramaguard.io</a>
        and the Slack application. If you have questions about this policy, contact us at
        <a href="mailto:privacy@dramaguard.io">privacy@dramaguard.io</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Workspace and account information.</strong> From Slack we may receive workspace and user identifiers, workspace name, team domain, and member profile fields permitted by Slack and your admin.</li>
        <li><strong>Message and channel context.</strong> In channels where our app is invited, we process message content and context necessary to detect drama patterns and provide coaching. Direct message scanning is off by default and can be disabled organization‑wide.</li>
        <li><strong>Derived features.</strong> To honor minimal data principles, we prefer storing features/labels derived from messages (e.g., drama role scores) rather than raw text when possible, according to your admin’s retention settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage and diagnostics.</strong> Events such as nudge interactions, response times, error logs, and device/browser metadata for the web dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Support communications.</strong> Information you provide when you contact us (name, email, company, and the content of your message).</li>
        <li><strong>Website data.</strong> Basic logs for security and performance. We do not use cross‑site advertising cookies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide and operate the Slack app and web dashboard.</li>
        <li>Deliver private coaching nudges and suggested rewrites to authors.</li>
        <li>Generate anonymized and k‑anonymous insights for teams and organizations.</li>
        <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot issues.</li>
        <li>Improve the accuracy and usefulness of detection and coaching features.</li>
        <li>Communicate with admins and users about updates, security, and support.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Legal bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract necessity</strong> to provide the service to your workspace.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> in improving safety, quality, and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent</strong> where required (e.g., optional features or marketing communications).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong> such as responding to lawful requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        Workspace admins can choose retention between 0–30 days for message‑related data. A “0‑day streaming” mode processes data transiently and stores only derived features where feasible. Support and operational records are kept as long as necessary for the purposes described, then deleted or anonymized. Backup copies are deleted on a rolling schedule.
      </p>

      <h2>How we share information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers (processors).</strong> We may use trusted vendors for hosting, logging/monitoring, analytics, email delivery, and customer support. These providers are bound by contractual confidentiality and data protection obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrations.</strong> We exchange necessary data with Slack via Slack’s APIs according to your workspace permissions and settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal and safety.</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or to protect users, our services, or the public from harm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell personal information.</p>

      <h2>International data transfers</h2>
      <p>
        If data is transferred internationally, we use appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses where applicable.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use industry‑standard security measures, including encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, audit logging, and least‑privilege practices. SOC 2 Type II is on our compliance roadmap.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights and choices</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict, or object to processing of your personal data, and to data portability. You can exercise these rights by contacting your workspace admin or <a href="mailto:privacy@dramaguard.io">privacy@dramaguard.io</a>. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        For California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended) provides additional rights, including the right to know, delete, correct, and opt‑out of certain sharing. We do not sell personal information or share it for cross‑context behavioral advertising.
      </p>

      <h2>Slack‑specific privacy controls</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Only channels where the app is invited are analyzed.</li>
        <li>Direct message scanning is off by default and can be disabled entirely.</li>
        <li>Admins can configure retention (0–30 days) and privacy preferences.</li>
        <li>Users can pause or opt out of nudges in accordance with workspace policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The service is not directed to children and should not be used by individuals under the age of 16.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and adjust the “Last updated” date. Material changes will be communicated through the service or by email where appropriate.
      </p>
