      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of Drama Guard’s website, Slack application,
        and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By installing, accessing, or using the Service, you agree to be bound
        by these Terms. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have authority
        to bind that organization and that acceptance of these Terms is on its behalf.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 16 years old and permitted by your organization and applicable law to use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Account and Workspace Administration</h2>
      <p>
        Installation and use within a Slack workspace may require administrator authorization. Workspace admins control configuration
        (including invited channels, data retention, privacy settings, and removal). You acknowledge that your use may be subject to
        your organization’s policies.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Use of the Service</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Permitted use.</strong> You may use the Service to detect and coach on drama dynamics and to view anonymized insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Acceptable use.</strong> You will not misuse the Service, including by attempting to reverse engineer, interfere with security,
          overload or disrupt systems, or use the Service to generate or disseminate harmful content.</li>
        <li><strong>Slack permissions.</strong> The Service processes content only in channels where the app is invited. Direct message scanning is
          off by default and can be disabled organization‑wide.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Subscriptions, Trials, and Billing</h2>
      <p>
        Access to certain features may require a paid subscription. Prices, plans, and limits are described on our pricing page
        or in an order form. Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions renew automatically until canceled by the admin. Trial features
        may be provided on an evaluation basis and can be modified or terminated at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        We retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the Service, including software, models, documentation, and branding.
        No rights are granted except as expressly stated in these Terms. You grant us a limited license to process data solely to
        provide and improve the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>7. User Content and Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent you or your workspace submit content to the Service, you grant us the rights necessary to operate the Service
        (including processing and generating derived features). If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a perpetual,
        irrevocable, royalty‑free license to use it without restriction.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> describes how we collect, use, and share information. By using the Service,
        you acknowledge our data practices as described there.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Service integrates with Slack and may rely on other third‑party providers. We are not responsible for third‑party
        services, their availability, or their terms and privacy practices.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Confidentiality</h2>
      <p>
        We will handle non‑public information received from you with reasonable care and use it solely to provide the Service,
        except as otherwise permitted by these Terms or required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement industry‑standard safeguards to protect information, including encryption in transit and at rest,
        access controls, and audit logging. No system is perfectly secure; you are responsible for maintaining the
        confidentiality of any credentials.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. We do not warrant
        that the Service will be uninterrupted or error‑free.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER DRAMA GUARD NOR ITS SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
        SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY,
        OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD‑WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE.
        OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOUR ORGANIZATION TO US FOR
        THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by law, you will indemnify and hold harmless Drama Guard and its affiliates from and against any
        claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses arising from your misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>15. Term and Termination</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms remain in effect while you use the Service. We may suspend or terminate access for violation of these Terms or
        to protect the Service or others. Upon termination, you must stop using the Service. Certain sections survive termination
        (including Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, and Indemnification).
      </p>

      <h2>16. Data Export and Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        Workspace admins may request data export (where applicable) and deletion according to our retention settings and Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>17. Changes to the Service and Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify the Service or these Terms from time to time. We will post updates here and adjust the “Last updated” date.
        Material changes will be communicated through the Service or by email where appropriate. If you continue to use the Service
        after changes take effect, you accept the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>18. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the state of California, excluding its conflict of law rules. Any disputes will be
        resolved in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you consent to their jurisdiction
        and venue. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Service.</li>
